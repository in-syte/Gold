Assignment 2 - Coding Assignment


The aim of this assignment is to gather data over time from a website and then display that data in the form of a time series chart in an HTML web page.

This breaks down into two coding exercises, firstly write Python code to retrieve data from a website by either scraping or using that sites API and store that data in a file and secondly the HTML/CSS/JavaScript to present that data using a chart in a web page on igor.gold.ac.uk.

Examples of the sort of data to be retrieved can be tweet volume over time for one or more hashtags, Facebook likes for a page, youtube views for one or more videos, github activity around a repository, bitcoin statistics or any public data that changes over a short time frame. Ideally you should be able to produce the time series for at least a period of a week but longer may be necessary if your source isnâ€™t dynamic enough.  This may require you to run the scraping code or API calls repeatedly over the time period to gather your data, once again depending on the type of data source chosen.

The submission should consist of a text or word document with 

a listing of attributions for any templates, libraries or any other tools used in the process.
a link to a github GIST of your Python code used to retrieve and store the data
a link to an HTML webpage on igor.gold.ac.uk that has the visualisation of your time series and the discussion. 
The webpage should include a brief discussion (approx 500 words) of the data you have collected and the visualisation process. Issues addressed should include the validity of your data and the collection method, possible interpretations and practical uses of the visualisation. Deeper analysis of the data is not required beyond the time series and you are not expected to produce a complete study but rather consider how this technique might fit into a larger study or workflow. The HTML page should be treated a complete artefact that can be shared (Social) and potentially found on google (SEO). It should be responsive, accessible and viewable on a tablet device. The chart should be JavaScript based, interactive and not a graphic embed. Suitable charting sources are google charts API, rickshaw, nvd3, D3, chartsjs or any JavaScript based charting library.  The HTML webpage should have a simple, clear and informative design. It cannot be a blog post.
